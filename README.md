# Git basics

Important steps for git workflow:

1. Initialize repository with git init. Create a .gitignore, for files you want to leave out of commits. 
2. Create changes to project files
3. Check status of those files with git status
4. Stage changes for commit with git add
5. Commit changes to version history with git commit -m 'message of your choice'
6. Review previous changes with git log.
